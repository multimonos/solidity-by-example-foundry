## Solidity by Example
These are some tests that I wrote while learning Solidity on the [Solidity By Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) site ... which is amazing!

I kept the tests and src code in the same file for simplicity.  The tests are not exhaustive, but, writing them helped me prove to myself that I understood what was happening and how to test for the use cases.


## Foundry
